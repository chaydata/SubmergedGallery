# SubmergedGallery
Text adventure game script written in Adventuron, for HPS1 Summer of Shivers game jam (Sep 2021).  
"Experience submechanophobia images with short captions and audio, in this retro virtual gallery."  

## GitHub code and License info
I decided to post the source code in case others making games in Adventuron want to add a similar feature in their game, make a similar kind of game, or just want to see how it works. This is kind of an unusual use case for Adventuron, since it is fully choice-based.  
Please feel free to use the code for your own games (no credit needed). Just don't take the whole thing or very large chunks without changing it much or at all - that's no fun! Note that this was written for the Adventuron betabeta version, which is slightly different from the current standard classroom.
